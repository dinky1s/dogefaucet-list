WOW!  Such a list of FREE Doge and other Cryptocoins available.  

If you're new to Dogecoin or Cryptocoins in general....you're welcome here.  Each Coin requires a wallet.<br>For Dogecoin, you can go here to get a FREE Wallet (http://dogecoin.com/)<br> For BitCoins go to [Coinbase] (https://coinbase.com/?r=52e871a6d06c00e58e00011d&utm_campaign=user-referral&src=referral-link) 


Now here's why you're here:  a list of sites that will give you a few coins for nothing more than the solve of a CAPTCHA (and maybe the viewing of an ad and the setting of a cookie or two): 

#### Please Note ####

Many of these are working when they're not dry....consider donating a small amount of Doge back to them so other's can benefit as well.
